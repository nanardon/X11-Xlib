=head1 NAME

X11::Xlib::Opaque - Base class for X11 opaque structures

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Base class for the various hidden C-structs of Xlib, which are represented
as a blessed opaque perl scalar, or blessed perl Hashref with the pointer
tucked away in XS magic.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 display

Find the display associated with this object.  This may return undef if the
opaque object was constructed from a source where the Display was unknown.
(for example, accessing the L<X11::Xlib::XVisualInfo/visual> when that struct
itself does not have a known Display.

The storage for this attribute is contained in XS, and is a strong reference
to the Display, which is released during the XS destructor for this object.

=head2 pointer_bytes

Return the raw pointer as a string of bytes (i.e. length 8 for 64-bit)

=head2 pointer_int

Return the raw pointer value as an integer
