    - Numerous tooling improvements and author tests
    - Update to Devel::PPPort-3.71

0.24 - 2023-08-16

    - Fix bugs when compiled for threaded perl

0.22 - 2021-10-09
    - New Atom API $conn->atom(@list), $conn->mkatom(@list) returns dualvars
      that are both the number and the atom name.
    - Fix bug in XGetWindowProperty/XChangeProperty on 64-bit platforms
      (thanks to Mark Davies)
    - Enhanced window property API can now encode and decode common property

0.20 - 2020-05-25
    - Fix XS double-free in unpacking ::Screen objects from Screen*
      (affected XWindowAttributes->unpack)
    - Improved XS API for unpacking structs to be able to find the
      Display* ptr, in order to return cached objects more often.
      (affects whether XWindowAttributes can return a cached ::Visual)
    - Embed literal version into every module, not just set at runtime.

    - New X11 API: error functions, atom functions, few XRender functions,

    - Add missing XMapRequest event type
    - Convenience method XEvent->summarize can pretty-print an event
    - Wrapper object (and typemap) for XserverRegion
    - All ::Struct and ::Opaque subclasses now have ->display attribute
    - More flexible caching of wrapper objects in Display
    - Convenience methods in Window wrapper for manipulating event mask,
      and for reading/writing attributes

0.14 - 2017-04-15
    - Fix bug in XEvent->window that was using the incorrect field for
       any struct that renames 'xany.window' to i.e. 'parent' or 'event'
    - New Xcomposite test attempts to use Xephyr if it is installed
    - Fix API of XCompositeQueryVersion, which takes in/out arguments
    - Only run X11-connected test cases when DISPLAY is set
    - Add configuration for Travis-CI
    - Doc updates

0.13 - 2017-04-13
    - Many new window attribute and window placement functions/constants

    - New structs XRectangle, XWindowAttributes, XWindowChanges
    - Xcomposite API, conditionally detected by makefile
    - A little bit of undocumented Xfixes API
    - Changed API for XGetGeometry, but still backward compatible

0.10 - 2017-04-06
    - implement Xlib API for screens, events, windows, pixmaps, colormaps,
      visual/visualinfo, keymaps, keysyms, input, and error handling.
    - more distinct separation between C-style API and object layer.
    - caching support for objects wrapping connections or XIDs
    - typemap handling for all the new supported objects
    - use ExtUtils::Depends to share C API and typemap with derived modules
