=head1 NAME

X11::Xlib - Low-level access to the X11 library

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # C-style
  
  use X11::Xlib ':all';
  my $display = XOpenDisplay($conn_string);
  XTestFakeMotionEvent($display, undef, 50, 50);
  XFlush($display);
  
  # or, Object-Oriented perl style:
  
  use X11::Xlib;
  my $display= X11::Xlib->new($conn_string);  # shortcut for X11::Xlib::Display->new
  $display->fake_motion(undef, 50, 50)
  $display->flush;

  # Remap Caps_Lock to a Smiley face
  
  use X11::Xlib;
  my $display= X11::Xlib->new;
  my $caps_code= $display->keymap->find_keycode('Caps_lock') // 0x42;
  $display->keymap->modmap_del_codes(lock => $caps_code);
  $display->keymap->keymap->[$caps_code]= [("U263A") x 4];
  $display->keymap->save;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides low-level access to Xlib functions.

This includes access to some X11 extensions like the X11 test library (Xtst).

If you import the Xlib functions directly, or call them as methods on an
instance of X11::Xlib, you get a near-C experience where you are required to
manage the lifespan of resources, XIDs are integers instead of objects, and the
library doesn't make any attempt to keep you from passing bad data to Xlib.

If you instead create a L<X11::Xlib::Display> object and call all your methods
on that, you get a more friendly wrapper around Xlib that helps you manage
resource lifespan, wraps XIDs with perl objects, and does some sanity checking
on the state of the library when you call methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

The X11::Xlib connection is a hashref with a few attributes and methods
independent of Xlib.

=head2 autoclose

Boolean flag that determines whether the destructor will call L</XCloseDisplay>.
Defaults to true for connections returned by L</XOpenDisplay>.

=head2 on_error

  # Global error handler
  X11::Xlib::on_error(\&my_callback);
  
  # Per-connection error handler
  my $display= X11::Xlib->new;
  $display->on_error(\&my_callback);
  
  sub my_callback {
    my ($display, $event)= @_;
    ...
  }


By default, Xlib aborts the program on a fatal error.  Use this method to
install an error-handling callback to gracefully catch and deal with errors.
On non-fatal errors, C<$event> will be the error event from the server.
On fatal errors, C<$event> will be C<undef>.  You can also install a handler
on an individual connection.  On a nonfatal error, both the connection and
global error handlers are invoked.  On a fatal error, all error handlers are
invoked.

Setting a value for this attribute automatically installs the Xlib error
handler, which isn't enabled by default.

Note that this callback is called from XS context, so your exceptions will
not travel up the stack.  Also note that on Xlib fatal errors, you cannot
call any more Xlib functions on the current connection, or on any connection
at all once the callback returns.

Be sure to read notes under L</"ERROR HANDLING">

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 new

This is an alias for C<< X11::Xlib::Display->new >>, to help encourage use
of the object oriented interface.

=head1 XLIB API

Most functions can be called as methods on the Xlib connection object, since
this is usually the first argument.  Every Xlib function listed below can be
exported, and you can grab them all with

  use X11::Xlib ':functions';

=head2 THREADING FUNCTIONS

=head3 XInitThreads

Sets up Xlib in a thread-safe manner, which basically means wrapping each Xlib
method with a mutex.  After this call, multiple threads may access the same
Display connection without application-level synchronization.
If used, this must be the first Xlib call in the whole program, which can be
inconvenient if you don't know in advance which other modules you are using.
While perl scripts are typically single-threaded, you might still require this
if you call into other libraries that create their own threads and also access
Xlib.

Returns true if multithread initialization succeeded.  If it fails, you
probably should abort.  (and then fix your program so that it is the first
Xlib function called)

=head3 XLockDisplay

Assuming XInitThreads succeeded, this will lock the Xlib mutex so you can run
multiple calls uninterrupted.

=head3 XUnlockDisplay

Release the lock taken by L</XLockDisplay>.

=head2 CONNECTION FUNCTIONS

=head3 XDisplayName

  my $conn_string= X11::Xlib::XDisplayName();
  my $conn_string= X11::Xlib::XDisplayName( $str );

Returns the official connection string Xlib will use if you were to call
C<XOpenDisplay($str)>.

=head3 XOpenDisplay

  my $display= X11::Xlib::XOpenDisplay($connection_string);

Instantiate a new (C-level) L</Display> instance. This object contains the
connection to the X11 display.  This will be an instance of C<X11::Xlib>.
The L<X11::Xlib::Display> object constructor is recommended instead.

The C<$connection_string> variable specifies the display string to open.
(C<"host:display.screen">, or often C<":0"> to connect to the only screen of
the only display on C<localhost>)
If unset, Xlib uses the C<$DISPLAY> environement variable.

If the handle goes out of scope, its destructor calls C<XCloseDisplay>, unless
you already called C<XCloseDisplay> or the X connection was lost.  (Be sure to
read the notes on L</"ERROR HANDLING">)

=head3 XCloseDisplay

  XCloseDisplay($display);
  # or, just:
  undef $display

Close a handle returned by C<XOpenDisplay>.  You do not need to call this method
since the handle's destructor does it for you, unless you want to forcibly
stop communicating with X and can't track down your references.  Once closed,
all further Xlib calls on the handle will die with an exception.

=head3 ConnectionNumber

  my $fh= IO::Handle->new_from_fd( $display->ConnectionNumber, 'w+' );

Return the file descriptor (integer) of the socket connected to the server.
This is useful for select/poll designs.
(See also: L<X11::Xlib::Display/wait_event>)

=head3 XSetCloseDownMode

  XSetCloseDownMode($display, $close_mode)

Determines what resources are freed upon disconnect.  See X11 documentation.

=head2 ATOM FUNCTIONS

The X11 server maintains an enumeration of strings, called Atoms.  By enumerating
the strings, it allows small integers to be exchanged instead of variable-length
identifiers, which makes parsing the protocol more efficient for both sides.
However clients need to look up (or create) the relevant atoms before they can be
used.  Be careful when creating atoms; they remain until the server is restarted.

=head3 XInternAtom

  my $atom_value= XInternAtom($display, $atom_name, $only_existing);

Get the value of a named atom.  If C<$only_existing> is true and the atom does
not already exist on the server, this function returns 0.  (which is not a valid
atom value)

=head3 XInternAtoms

  my $atoms_array= XInternAtoms($display, \@atom_names, $only_existing);

Same as above, but look up multiple atoms at once, for round-trip efficiency.
The returned array will always be the same length as C<@atom_names>, but will
have 0 for any atom value that didn't exist if C<$only_existing> was true.

=head3 XGetAtomName

  my $name= XGetAtomName($display, $atom_value);

Return the name of an atom.  If the atom is not defined this generates a
protocol error (can be caught by C</on_error> handler) and returns undef.

=head3 XGetAtomNames

  my $names_array= XGetAtomNames($display, \@atom_values);

Same as above, but look up multiple atoms at once, for round-trip efficiency.
If any atom does not exist, this generates a protocol error, but if you catch
the error then this function will return an array the same length as
C<@atom_values> with C<undef> for each atom that didn't exist.

=head2 COMMUNICATION FUNCTIONS

Most of these functions return an L</XEvent> by way of an "out" parameter that
gets overwritten during the call, in the style of C.  The variable receiving the
event does not need to be initialized.

=head3 XQLength

  my $count= XQLength($display);

Return number of events already in the incoming queue, without trying to read
more.

=head3 XPending

  my $count= XPending($display);

Return number of events in incoming queue after performing a flush and a read.

=head3 XEventsQueued

  my $count= XEventsQueued($display, $mode);

C<$mode> is one of QueuedAlready, QueuedAfterFlush, or QueuedAfterReading.
QueuedAlready simply returns the queue size.  QueuedAfterReading performs a
read, then returns the count.  QueuedAfterFlush performs a flush and a read,
then returns the count.

=head3 XNextEvent

  XNextEvent($display, my $event_return)
  ... # event scalar is populated with event

You probably don't want this.  It blocks forever until an event arrives, even
ignoring signals.  I added it for completeness.
See L<X11::Xlib::Display/wait_event> for a more perl-ish interface.

=head3 XCheckMaskEvent

=head3 XCheckWindowEvent

=head3 XCheckTypedEvent

=head3 XCheckTypedWindowEvent

  if ( XCheckMaskEvent($display, $event_mask, my $event_return) ) ...
  if ( XCheckTypedEvent($display, $event_type, my $event_return) ) ...
  if ( XCheckWindowEvent($display, $event_mask, $window, my $event_return) ) ...
  if ( XCheckTypedWindowEvent($display, $event_type, $window, my $event_return) ) ...

Each of these variations checks whether there is a matching event received from
the server and not yet extracted form the message queue.  If so, it stores the
event into C<$event_return> and returns true.  Else it returns false without
blocking.

(Xlib also has another variant that uses a callback to choose which message to
 extract, but I didn't implement that because it seemed like a pain and probably
 nobody would use it.)

=head3 XSendEvent

  XSendEvent($display, $window, $propagate, $event_mask, $xevent)
    or die "Xlib hates us";

Send an XEvent to the server, to be redispatched however appropriate.

=head3 XPutBackEvent

  XPutBackEvent($display, $xevent)

Push an XEvent back onto your own incoming queue.
This can presumably put arbitrarily bogus events onto your own queue
since it returns void.

=head3 XFlush

  XFlush($display)

Push any queued messages to the X11 server.  Some Xlib calls perform an
implied flush of the queue, while others don't.  If you're wondering why
nothing happened when you called an XTest function, this is why.

=head3 XSync

  XSync($display);
  XSync($display, $discard);

Force a round trip to the server to process all pending messages and receive
the responses (or errors).  A true value for the second argument will wipe your
incoming event queue.

=head3 XSelectInput

  XSelectInput($display, $window, $event_mask)

Change the event mask for a window.  Note that event masks are B<per-client>,
so one client can listen to a window with a different mask than a second
client listening to the same window.

=head3 XGetErrorText

  my $error_description= XGetErrorText($display, $error_code);

=head3 XGetErrorDatabaseText

  my $msg= XGetErrorDatabaseText($display, $name, $message, $default_string);

$name indicates what sort of thing to look up. $message is a stringified code
of some sort.  Yes this is really weird for a C API.

  my $msg= XGetErrorDatabaseText($display, 'XProtoError', $error_code, $default);
  my $msg= sprintf(
    XGetErrorDatabaseText($display, 'XlibMessage', 'MajorCode', "Request Major Code %d"),
    $event->request_code
  );
  my $message= XGetErrorDatabaseText($display, 'XRequest', $request_code);

Just use L<X11::Xlib::XEvent/summarize> on an XErrorEvent and save yourself
the trouble.

=head2 SCREEN ATTRIBUTES

Xlib provides opaque L</Display> and L</Screen> structs which have locally-
stored attributes, but which you must use method calls to access.
For each attribute of a screen, there are four separate ways to access it:

  DisplayFoo($display, $screen_num);     # C Macro like ->{screens}[$screen_num]{foo}
  XDisplayFoo($display, $screen_num);    # External linked function from Xlib
  FooOfScreen($screen_pointer);          # C Macro like ->{foo}
  XFooOfScreen($screen_pointer);         # External linked function from Xlib

Since screen pointers become invalid when the Display is closed, I decided not
to expose them, and since DisplayFoo and XDisplayFoo are identical I decided
to only implement the first since it makes one less symbol to link from Xlib.

So, if you grab some sample code from somewhere and wonder where those functions
went, drop the leading X and do a quick search on this page.

=head3 ScreenCount

  my $n= ScreenCount($display);

Return number of configured L</Screen>s of this display.

=head3 DisplayWidth

=head3 DisplayHeight

  my $w= DisplayWidth($display, $screen);
  my $h= DisplayHeight($display, $screen);
  # use instead of WidthOfScreen, HeightOfScreen

Return the width or height of screen number C<$screen>.  You can omit the
C<$screen> paramter to use the default screen of your L<Display> connection.

=head3 DisplayWidthMM

=head3 DisplayHeightMM

  my $w= DisplayWidthMM($display, $screen);
  my $h= DisplayHeightMM($display, $screen);
  # use instead of WidthMMOfScreen, HeightMMOfScreen

Return the physical width or height (in millimeters) of screen number C<$screen>.
You can omit the screen number to use the default screen of the display.

=head3 RootWindow

  my $xid= RootWindow($display, $screen)

Return the XID of the X11 root window.  C<$screen> is optional, and defaults to the
default screen of your connection.
If you want a Window object, call this method on L<X11::Xlib::Display>.

=head3 DefaultVisual

  my $visual= DefaultVisual($display, $screen);
  # use instead of DefaultVisualOfScreen

Screen is optional and defaults to the default screen of your connection.
This returns a L</Visual>, not a L</XVisualInfo>.

=head3 DefaultDepth

  my $bits_per_pixel= DefaultDepth($display, $screen);
  # use instead of DefaultDepthOfScreen, DisplayPlanes, PlanesOfScreen

Return bits-per-pixel of the root window of a screen.
If you omit C<$screen> it uses the default screen.

=head2 VISUAL/COLORMAP FUNCTIONS

=head3 XMatchVisualInfo

  XMatchVisualInfo($display, $screen, $depth, $class, my $xvisualinfo_return)
    or die "Don't have one of those";

Loads the details of a L</Visual> into the final argument,
which must be an L</XVisualInfo> (or undefined, to create one)

Returns true if it found a matching visual.

=head3 XGetVisualInfo

  my @info_structs= XGetVisualInfo($display, $mask, $xvis_template);

Returns a list of L</XVisualInfo> each describing an available L</Visual>
which matches the template you provided. (which is also an C<XVisualInfo>)

C<$mask> can be any combination of:

  VisualIDMask
  VisualScreenMask
  VisualDepthMask
  VisualClassMask
  VisualRedMaskMask
  VisualGreenMaskMask
  VisualBlueMaskMask
  VisualColormapSizeMask
  VisualBitsPerRGBMask
  VisualAllMask

each describing a field of L<X11::Xlib::XVisualInfo> which is relevant
to your search.

=head3 XVisualIDFromVisual

  my $vis_id= XVisualIDFromVisual($visual);
  # or, assuming $visual is blessed,
  my $vis_id= $visual->id;

Pull the visual ID out of the opaque object $visual.

If what you wanted was actually the L</XVisualInfo> for a C<$visual>, then try:

  my ($vis_info)= GetVisualInfo($display, VisualIDMask, { visualid => $vis_id });
  # or with Display object:
  $display->visual_by_id($vis_id);

=head3 XCreateColormap

  my $xid= XCreateColormap($display, $rootwindow, $visual, $alloc_flag);
  # or 99% of the time
  my $xid= XCreateColormap($display, RootWindow($display), DefaultVisual($display), AllocNone);
  # and thus these are the defaults
  my $xid= XCreateColormap($display);

Create a L</Colormap>.  The C<$visual> is a L</Visual>
object, and the C<$alloc_flag> is either C<AllocNone> or C<AllocAll>.

=head3 XFreeColormap

  XFreeColormap($display, $colormap);

Delete a L</Colormap>, and set the colormap to C<None> for any window that was
using it.

=head3 Colormap TODO

  XInstallColormap XUninstallColormap, XListInstalledColormaps
  XGetWMColormapWindows XSetWMColormapWindows, XSetWindowColormap
  XAllocColor XStoreColors XFreeColors XAllocColorPlanes XAllocNamedColor
  XQueryColors XCopyColormapAndFree

If anyone actually needs palette graphics anymore, send me a patch :-)

=head2 PIXMAP FUNCTIONS

=head3 XCreatePixmap

  my $xid= XCreatePixmap($display, $drawable, $width, $height, $depth);

The C<$drawable> parameter is just used to determine the screen.
You probably want to pass either C<DefaultRootWindow($display)> or the window
you're creating the pixmap for.

=head3 XFreePixmap

  XFreePixmap($display, $pixmap);

=head3 XCreateBitmapFromData

  my $pixmap_xid= XCreateBitmapFromData($display, $drawable, $data, $width, $height);

First, be aware that in X11, a "bitmap" is literally a "Bit" "Map" (1 bit per pixel).

The C<$drawable> determines which screen the pixmap is created for.
The C<$data> is a string of bytes.

The C<$data> should technically be opaque, written by another X11 function
after having rendering graphics to a pixmap or something, but since those
aren't implemented here yet, you'll just have to know the format.

=head3 XCreatePixmapFromBitmapData

  my $pixmap_xid= XCreatePixmapFromBitmapData($display, $drawable, $data,
    $width, $height, $fg, $bg, $depth);

This function uses a bitmap (1 bit per pixel) and a foreground and background
color to build a pixmap of those two colors.  It's basically upscaling color
from monochrome to C<$depth>.

=head2 WINDOW FUNCTIONS

=head3 XCreateWindow

  my $wnd_xid= XCreateWindow(
    $display,
    $parent_window,  # such as DefaultRootWindow()
    $x, $y,
    $width, $height,
    $border_width,
    $color_depth,    # such as $visual_info->depth or DefaultDepth($display)
    $class,          # InputOutput, InputOnly, or CopyFromParent
    $visual,         # such as $visual_info->visual or DefaultVisual($display)
    $attr_mask,      # indicates which fields of \%attrs are initialized
    \%attrs          # struct XSetWindowAttributes or hashref of its fields
  );

The parameters the probably need more explanation are C<$visual> and C<%attrs>.

C<$visual> is a L</Visual>.  You probably either want to use the default visual
of the screen (L</DefaultVisual>) or look up your own visual using
L</XGetVisualInfo> or L</XMatchVisualInfo> (which is a L</VisualInfo>, and has
an attribute C<< ->visual >>).  In the second case, you should also pass
C<< $visual_info->depth >> as the C<$depth> parameter, and create a matching
L</Colormap> which you pass via the C<\%attrs> parameter.

Since this function didn't have nearly enough parameters for the imaginations
of the Xlib creators, they added the full L<X11::Xlib::XSetWindowAttributes> structure
as a final argument.  But to save you the trouble of setting all I<those>
fields, they added an C<$attr_mask> to indicate which fields you are using.
Simply OR together the constants listed in that struct.  If C<$attr_mask> is
zero, then C<\%attrs> may be C<undef>.

The window is initially un-mapped (i.e. hidden).  See L</XMapWindow>

=head3 XCreateSimpleWindow

  my $wnd_xid= XCreateSimpleWindow(
    $display, $parent_window,
    $x, $y, $width, $height,
    $border_width, $border_color, $background_color
  );

This function basically creates a "child window", clipped to its parent, with
all the same visual configuration.

It is initially unmapped.  See L</XMapWindow>.

=head3 XMapWindow

  XMapWindow($display, $window);

Ask the X server to show a window.  This call is asynchronous and you should call
L</XFlush> if you want it to appear immediately.  The window will only appear if
the parent window is also mapped.  The server sends back a MapNotify event if
the Window event mask allows it, and if a variety of other conditions are met.
It's really pretty complicated and you should read the offical docs.

=head3 XUnmapWindow

  XUnmapWindow($display, $window);

Hide a window.

=head3 XGetGeometry

  my ($root, $x, $y, $width, $height, $border_width, $color_depth)
    = XGetGeometry($display, $drawable)
    or die "XGetGeometry failed";

=head3 XGetWindowAttributes

  my $bool= XGetWindowAttributes($display, $window, $attrs_out);

Populate $attrs_out, which should be an undefined variable or a buffer or an
instance of L<X11::Xlib::XWindowAttributes>.  If it returns false,
C<$attrs_out> remains unchanged.

=head3 XChangeWindowAttributes

  XChangeWindowAttributes($display, $window, $valuemask, \%XSetWindowAttributes)

Apply one or more fields of the L<X11::Xlib::XSetWindowAttributes> struct to
the specified window.  C<$valuemask> is a ORed combination of the flags listed
for that struct.

=head3 XSetWindowBackground

  XSetWindowBackground($display, $window, $background_pixel)

Set the background pixel color (integer) for the window.

=head3 XSetWindowBackgroundPixmap

  XSetWindowBackgroundPixmap($display, $window, $background_pixmap)

=head3 XSetWindowBorder

  XSetWindowBorder($display, $window, $border_pixel)

=head3 XSetWindowBorderPixmap

  XSetWindowBorderPixmap($display, $window, $border_pixmap)

=head3 XSetWindowColormap

  XSetWindowColormap($display, $window, $colormap)

=head3 XDefineCursor

  XDefineCursor($display, $window, $cursor)

=head3 XUndefineCursor

  XUndefineCursor($display, $window)

=head3 XReparentWindow

  XReparentWindow($display, $wnd, $new_parent, $x, $y);

Unmap, change parent, and remap C<$wnd> to be a child of C<$parent>.
The X and Y arguments set the new location of the window relative to the
parent client space.

=head3 XConfigureWindow

  XConfigureWindow($display, $window, $mask, \%XWindowChanges);

Set the size, position, border, and stacking order of a window.
L<X11::Xlib::XWindowChanges> can be passed as an object or plain hashref.
C<$mask> is an ORed combination of the constants listed in the documentation
for that struct, indicating which fields have been initialized.

=head3 XMoveWindow

  XMoveWindow($display, $window, $x, $y);

=head3 XResizeWindow

  XResizeWindow($display, $window, $width, $height)

=head3 XMoveResizeWindow

  XMoveResizeWindow($display, $window, $x, $y, $width, $height)

=head3 XSetWindowBorderWidth

  XSetWindowBorderWidth($display, $window, $border_width)

=head3 XQueryTree

  my ($root, $parent, @children)= XQueryTree($display, $window);

Return windows related to C<$window>.  Child windows are returned in
bottom-to-top stacking order.  Returns an empty list if it fails.

=head3 XRaiseWindow

  XRaiseWindow($display, $window);

Move window to front of stacking order.

=head3 XLowerWindow

 XLowerWindow($display, $window);

Move window to back of stacking order.

=head3 XCirculateSubwindows

  XCirculateSubwindows($display, $parent_window, $direction);

For the child windows of the given window, either bring the back-most to the
front (C<direction == RaiseLowest>), or the front-most to the back
(C<direction == LowerHighest>).

(Note: use this instead of XCirculateSubwindowsUp or XCirculateSubwindowsDown)

=head3 XRestackWindows

  XRestackWindows($display, \@windows);

Reset the stacking order of the specified windows, from front to back.

=head3 XListProperties

  my @prop_atoms= XListProperties($display, $window);
  print "Window has these properties: ".join(", ", @{ XGetAtomNames($display, \@prop_atoms, 1) });

Returns an arrayref of all defined properties on the specified window.

=head3 XGetWindowProperty

  my $success= XGetWindowProperty($display, $wnd, $prop_atom, $offset, $length, $delete, $req_type,
        my $actual_type, my $actual_format, my $nitems, my $bytes_after, my $data);

Welcome to the wonderful world of X11 Window Properties!  You pick the
property using C<$prop_atom> (see L</XInternAtom>) and then request some range
of the bytes that compose it (using C<$offset>*4 and C<$length>*4, which are
a count of 4-byte units, not bytes) request to delete it with C<$delete>,
request the resource be given to you as C<$req_type> (also an Atom), and then
receive all the actual values in the last 5 variables.

C<$actual_format> is either 8, 16, or 32 indicating the multiplier for
C<$nitems>.  But you can just check C<length($data)> to save time.

The details are complicated enough you should go read the X11 docs, but a quick
example is:

  my $netwmname= XInternAtom($display, "_NET_WM_NAME");
  my $type_utf8= XInternAtom($display, "UTF8_STRING");
  if (XGetWindowProperty($display, $wnd, $netwmname, 0, 32, 0, $type_utf8,
        my $actual_type, my $actual_format, my $n, my $remaining, my $data)
  ) {
    say $data; # should check $actual_type, but it's probably readable text.
    say "window title was longer than 128 bytes" if $remaining > 0;
  }

=head3 XChangeProperty

  XChangeProperty($display, $wnd, $prop_atom, $type_atom, $format, $mode, $data, $nitems);

C<$prop_atom> determines what property is being written.  C<$type_atom>
declares the logical type of the data.  C<$format> is 8, 16, or 32 to determine
the word size of the data (used by X server for endian swapping).  C<$mode> is
one of: C<PropModeReplace>, C<PropModePrepend>, C<PropModeAppend>.  C<$data>
is a scalar that must be at least as long as C<$nitems> * C<$format> bits.

=head3 XDeleteProperty

  XDeleteProperty($display, $window, $prop_atom);

Deletes the property from the window if it exists.  No error is raised if it
doesn't exist.

=head3 XGetWMProtocols

  my @atoms= XGetWMProtocols($display, $wnd);

Returns a list of protocols (identifiers, represented as L<atoms|/"ATOM FUNCTIONS">)
which the owner of this window claims to support.  If a protocol's atom is in
this list then you can send that sort of ClientMessage events to this window.

=head3 XSetWMProtocols

  XSetWMProtocols($display, $wnd, \@procol_atoms)
    or die "Failed to set WM_PROTOCOLS";

Set the list of protocols you want to respond to for this window.
For example, to advertise support for standard "close" events:

  my $close_atom= XInternAtrom($display, "WM_DELETE_WINDOW", 0);
  XSetWMProtocols($display, $window, [ $close_atom ]);

=head3 XGetWMNormalHints

  my ($hints_out, $supplied_fields_out);
  XGetWMNormalHints($display, $window, $hints_out, $supplied_fields_out)
    or warn "Doesn't have WM hints";

If a window has Window Manager Normal Hints defined on it, this function will
store them into the C<$hints_out> variable (which will become a L<X11::Xlib::XSizeHints>
if it wasn't already).  It will also set the bits of C<$supplied_fields_out> to
indicate which fields the X11 server knows about.  This is different from the
bits in C<< $hints_out->flags >> that indicate which individual fields are defined
for this window.

=head3 XSetWMNormalHints

  XSetWMNormalHints($display, $window, $hints);

Set window manager hints for the specified window.  C<$hints> is an instance of
L<X11::Xlib::XSizeHints>, or a hashref of its fields.  Note that the C<< ->flags >>
member of this struct will be initialized for you if you pass a hashref, according
to what fields exist in the hashref.

=head3 XDestroyWindow

  XDestroyWindow($display, $window);

Unmap and destroy a window.

=head2 XTEST INPUT SIMULATION

These methods create fake server-wide input events, useful for automated testing.
They are available through the XTest extension.  Currently this extension is a
mandatory requirement for installing this module, and so these functions are
always available.

Don't forget to call L</XFlush> after these methods, if you want the events to
happen immediately.

=head3 XTestFakeMotionEvent

  XTestFakeMotionEvent($display, $screen, $x, $y, $EventSendDelay)

Fake a mouse movement to position C<$x>,C<$y> on screen number C<$screen>.

The optional C<$EventSendDelay> parameter specifies the number of milliseconds to wait
before sending the event. The default is 10 milliseconds.

=head3 XTestFakeButtonEvent

  XTestFakeButtonEvent($display, $button, $pressed, $EventSendDelay)

Simulate an action on mouse button number C<$button>. C<$pressed> indicates whether
the button should be pressed (true) or released (false). 

The optional C<$EventSendDelay> parameter specifies the number of milliseconds ro wait
before sending the event. The default is 10 milliseconds.

=head3 XTestFakeKeyEvent

  XTestFakeKeyEvent($display, $kc, $pressed, $EventSendDelay)

Simulate a event on any key on the keyboard. C<$kc> is the key code (8 to 255),
and C<$pressed> indicates if the key was pressed or released.

The optional C<$EventSendDelay> parameter specifies the number of milliseconds to wait
before sending the event. The default is 10 milliseconds.

See L<X11::Xlib::Keymap/EXAMPLES>.

=head2 KEYSYM FUNCTIONS

These utility functions help identify and convert KeySym values, and do not
depend on a connection to an X server.

=head3 XKeysymToString

  my $ident= XKeysymToString($keysym)

Return the ASCII identifier of the KeySym (as in X11/keysym.h) minus the
leading "XK_" prefix, or undef of that fails for some reason.

C<XKeysymToString> is the exact reverse of C<XStringToKeysym>.

=head3 XStringToKeysym

  my $keysym= XStringToKeysym($string)

Return the keysym number for the symbolic identifier C<$string>.
(as per X11/keysym.h, minus the XK_ prefix)

C<XStringToKeysym> is the reverse of C<XKeysymToString>.

=head3 codepoint_to_keysym

  my $keysym= codepoint_to_keysym(ord($char));

Convert a Unicode codepoint to a KeySym value.  This isn't a true Xlib
function, but fills a gap in the API since Xlib is pretty weak on unicode
handling.  Every normal unicode codepoint has a keysym value, but if you
pass an invalid codepoint you will get C<undef>.

=head3 keysym_to_codepoint

  my $cp= keysym_to_codepoint($keysym);
  my $char= defined $cp? chr($cp) : undef;

Convert a KeySym to a unicode codepoint.  Many KeySyms (like F1, Control, etc)
do not have any character associated with them, and will return C<undef>.
Again, not actually part of Xlib, but provided here for convenience.

=head3 char_to_keysym

Like L</codepoint_to_keysym> example above, but takes a string from which it
calls L<ord()> on the first character.  Returns undef if the string doesn't
have a first character.

=head3 keysym_to_char

Like L</keysym_to_codepoint> example above, but returns a string if there is
a valid codepoint, and C<undef> otherwise.

=head3 XConvertCase

  XConvertCase($keysym, $lowercase_out, $uppercase_out);

Return the lowercase and uppercase KeySym values for C<$keysym>.

=head3 IsFunctionKey

  IsFunctionKey($keysym)

Return true if C<$keysym> is a function key (F1 .. F35)

=head3 IsKeypadKey

  IsKeypadKey($keysym)

Return true if C<$keysym> is on numeric keypad.

=head3 IsMiscFunctionKey

  IsMiscFunctionKey($keysym)

Return true if key is... no clue :/ and not documented anywhere??

=head3 IsModifierKey

  IsModifierKey($keysym)

Return true if C<$keysym> is a modifier key (Shift, Alt).

=head3 IsPFKey

  IsPFKey($keysym)

Xlib docs are fun.  No mention of what "PF" might be.

=head3 IsPrivateKeypadKey

  IsPrivateKeypadKey($keysym)

True for vendor-private key codes.

=head2 INPUT FUNCTIONS

=head3 XSetInputFocus

  XSetInputFocus($display, $wnd_focus, $revert_to, $time);

Change input focus and set last-focus-time if C<$time> is after the current
last-focus-time and before the current time of the X server.

C<$time> can be CurrentTime to use the X server's clock.

C<$wnd_focus> can be None to discard all keyboard input until a new window is
focused, or PointerRoot to actively track the root window of whatever screen
the pointer moves to.

Once the target window becomes un-viewable, the C<$revert_to> setting takes
effect, and can be C<RevertToParent>, C<RevertToPointerRoot>, or C<RevertToNone>.

=head3 XQueryKeymap

  XQueryKeymap($display)

Return a list of the key codes currently pressed on the keyboard.

=head3 XGrabKeyboard

  $bool= XGrabKeyboard($display, $window, $owner_events, $pointer_mode, $keyboard_mode, $timestamp)

Direct foxus to the specified window.  See X11 docs.

=head3 XUngrabKeyboard

  XUngrabKeyboard($display, $timestamp)

=head3 XGrabKey

  XGrabKey($display, $keycode, $modifiers, $window, $owner_events, $pointer_mode, $keyboard_mode)

Register a window to receive any matching key events, optionally hiding them
from the normal target window.

C<$keycode> is the keyboard scan code to watch for, or C<AnyKey>.
C<$modifiers> is a bit mask combined from C<ControlMask>, C<LockMask>,
C<Mod1Mask>, C<Mod2Mask>, C<Mod3Mask>, C<Mod4Mask>, C<Mod5Mask>, C<ShiftMask>,
or the special mask C<AnyModifier> which means any I<or none> of the modifiers.
C<$window> is the XID or L<X11::Xlib::Window> to direct events toward.
C<$owner_events> is a boolean of whether to also let the normal target of the
key event receive them.  C<$pointer_mode> and C<$keyboard_mode> are either
C<GrabModeSync> or C<GrabModeAsync>.

=head3 XUngrabKey

  XUngrabKey($display, $keycode, $modifiers, $window)

Cancel a grab registered by L</XGrabKey>.

=head3 XGrabPointer

  $bool= XGrabPointer($display, $window, $owner_events, $event_mask,
    $pointer_mode, keyboard_mode, confine_to, cursor, timestamp)

=head3 XUngrabPointer

  XUngrabPointer(dpy, timestamp)

=head3 XGrabButton

  XGrabButton($display, $button, $modifiers, $window, $owner_events,
    $event_mask, $pointer_mode, $keyboard_mode, $confine_to, $cursor)

=head3 XUngrabButton

  XUngrabButton($display, $button, $modifiers, $window)

=head3 XAllowEvents

  XAllowEvents($display, $event_mode, $timestamp)

If grab modes used above are C<GrabModeSync> then further X11 input processing
is halted until you call this function.  See X11 docs.

=head3 XGetKeyboardMapping

  XGetKeyboardMapping($display, $keycode, $count)

Return an array of KeySym numbers corresponding to C<$count> key codes,
starting at C<$keycode>.

Each position in the per-key array corresponds to a combination of key
modifiers (Shift, Lock, Mode).  The X11 server may return a variable number
of codes per key, which you can determine by dividing the total number of
values returned by this function by the C<$count>.

For a more perl-friendly interface, see L</load_keymap>.  For object-oriented
access, see L<X11::Xlib::Keymap>.

=head3 XChangeKeyboardMapping

  XChangeKeyboardMapping($display, $first_keycode, $keysym_per_keycode, \@keysyms, $num_codes);
  
  # Best explained with an example...
  # KeySym in 0x20..0x7E map directly from Latin1
  my @keycodes= (
    ord('a'), ord('A'), ord('a'), ord('A'),  # want to assign these KeySym to KeyCode 38
    ord('s'), ord('S'), ord('s'), ord('S'),  # and these to KeyCode 39
  );
  XChangeKeyboardMapping($display, 38, 4, \@keycodes, scalar @keycodes);

Update some/all of the KeySyms attached to one or more KeyCodes.
In the example above, only the first 4 KeySyms of each KeyCode will be changed.
Specify a larger number of C<$keysym_per_keycode> to overwrite more of them.

For a more perl-friendly interface, see L</save_keymap>.  For object-oriented
access, see L<X11::Xlib::Keymap>.

=head3 load_keymap

  my $keymap= load_keymap($display, $symbolic, $min_key, $max_key);
  my $keymap= load_keymap($display, $symbolic); # all keys
  my $keymap= load_keymap($display); # all keys, symbolic=2

This is a wrapper around L</XGetKeyboardMapping> which returns an arrayref
of arrayrefs, and also translates KeySym values into KeySym names or unicode
characters.  If C<$symbolic> is 0, the elements of the arrays are KeySym numbers.
If C<$symbolic> is 1, the elements are the KeySym name (or integers, if a name
is not available).
If C<$symbolic> is 2, the elements are characters for every KeySym that can be
un-ambiguously represented by a character, else KeySym names, else integers.

The minimum KeyCode of an X server is never below 8.  If you omit C<$min_key>
it defaults to 0, and so the returned array will always have at least 8 undef
values at the start.  This minor waste allows you to index into the array
directly with a KeyCode.

=head3 save_keymap

  save_keymap($display, \@keymap, $min_key, $max_key);
  save_keymap($display, \@keymap); # to update all keycodes

This is a wrapper around L</XChangeKeyboardMapping> that accepts the same
array-of-arrays returned by L</load_keymap>.  The first element of the array
is assumed to be C<$min_key> B<unless the array is longer than C<$max_key> >
in which case the array is assumed to start at 0 and you are requesting that
only elements C<($min_key .. $max_key)> be sent to the X server.

Each element of the inner array can be an integer KeySym, or a KeySym name
recognized by L</XStringToKeysym>, or a single unicode character.
If the KeySym is an integer, it must be at least two integer digits, which
all real KeySyms should be (other than C<NoSymbol> which has the value 0, and
should be represented by C<undef>) to avoid ambiguity with the characters of
the number keys.  i.e. "4" means "the KeySym for the character 4" rather than
the KeySym value 4.

=head3 XGetModifierMapping

  my $mapping= XGetModifierMapping($display);

Return an arrayref of 8 arrayrefs, one for each modifier group.
The inner arrayrefs can contain a variable number of key codes which belong
to the modifier group.  See L<X11::Xlib::Keymap> for an explanation.

=head3 XSetModifierMapping

  XSetModifierMapping($display, \@modifiers);

C<@modifiers> is an array of 8 arrayrefs, each holding the set of key codes
that are part of the modifier.  This is the same format as returned by
C<XGetModifierMapping>.

=head3 XRefreshKeyboardMapping

  XRefreshKeyboardMapping($mapping_event);

Given a XMappingEvent, reload the internal Xlib cache for the parts of the
keymap or modmap which have changed.

The functions below (using the internal Xlib cache) are an alternative to
processing the keymap directly.

=head3 XLookupString

  XLookupString($key_event, $text_out, $keycode_out);

Given a XKeyEvent, translate the key code and modifiers vs. the internal Xlib
cached keymap/modmap and write the text name of the key into C<$text_out>.
This will either be a name of a key, or the character the key normally
generates in a Latin-1 environment.  If C<$keycode_out> is given, it will be
overwritten with the numeric value of the KeySym.

(If you want to do more than Latin-1, see L<X11::Xlib::Keymap> for utilities
 to manipulate the keymap directly.)

=head3 XKeysymToKeycode

  my $keycode= XKeysymToKeycode($display, $keysym)

Return the key code corresponding to C<$keysym> in the current mapping.

=head3 XBell

  XBell($display, $percent)

Make the X server emit a sound.

=head2 RESOURCE FUNCTIONS

These functions provide an interface to the X resources manager and databases. Functions
whose first parameter is a databse handle may be used as methods on the handle by importing
L<X11::Xib::XrmDatabase>.

=head3 XrmInitialize

  XrmInitialize();

Initialize the resource manager.

=head3 XrmGetFileDatabase

  $database = XrmGetFileDatabase( $filename );

Create a resource database from an X resource file.

=head3 XrmPutFileDatabase

  XrmPutFileDatabase( $database, $filename );

=head3 XResourceManagerString

  $string = XResourceManagerString( $display );

Return the C<RESOURCE_MANAGER> property from the root window of screen zero.

=head3 XScreenResourceString

  $string = XScreenResourceString( $screen );

Return the C<SCREEN_RESOURCES> property from the root window of the specified screen.

=head3 XrmGetStringDatabase

  $database = XrmGetStringDatabase( $data );

Create a new database from resources specified in the string specified in C<$data>.  The string
should have the same format as an X resource file.

=head3 XrmLocaleOfDatabase

  $string = XrmLocaleOfDatabase( $database );

Return the name of the locale bound to the database.

=head3 XrmDestroyDatabase(database)

  XrmDestroyDatabase( $database );

=head3 XrmSetDatabase

  XrmSetDatabase( $display, $database );

Associate the resource database with the display.

=head3 XrmGetDatabase

  $database = XrmGetDatabase( $display );

Return the database associated with the display.

=head3 XrmCombineFileDatabase

  $status = XrmCombineFileDatabase( $filename, $target_db, $override );

Merge the contents of a resource file into a database. If C<$target_db>
is undef or not an existing database, it will be set to a newly
created database.

If C<$override> is true, entries in C<$filename> will replace those in
C<$target_db>.

Returns zero if there is an error.

=head3 XrmCombineDatabase

  XrmCombineDatabase( $source_db, $target_db, $override );

Merge the contents of C<$source_db> into C<$target_db>.
If C<$override> is true, entries in C<$source_db> will replace those
in C<$target_db>.

If C<$target_db> is undef or not an existing database, it be set to
C<$source_db>.

C<$source_db> will be invalidated by this function.

=head3 XrmMergeDatabases

   XrmMergeDatabases( $source_db, $target_db );

The same as calling L</XrmCombinDatabase> with C<$override = 1>.

=head3 XrmGetResource

  ($bool, $type, $value ) = XrmGetResource( $database, $name, $class );

Retrieve a resource with the given C<$name> and C<$class>.  C<$bool> is true if
the resource was found.  If C<$type> is C<String>, C<$value> contains a string.
Otherwise, it is up to the user to decode it,

=head3 XrmPutResource( XrmDatabaseMaybe database, specifier, type, value )

  XrmPutResource( $database, $specifier, $type, $value );

Store the resource in the specified database.  If C<$database> is
C<undef> or not an existing database, a new one will be created and
the handle stored in C<$database>.  If C<$type> is C<String>, the
C<$value> is assumed to be a Perl string and will be stored as a
string, otherwise it is stored as is.

=head3 XrmPutStringResource( XrmDatabaseMaybe database, specifier, value )

  XrmPutStringResource( $database, $specifier, $value );

Store the resource as a string the specified database.  If C<$database> is
C<undef> or not an existing database, a new one will be created and
the handle stored in C<$database>.

=head3 XrmPutLineResource( XrmDatabaseMaybe database, line )

  XrmPutLineResource( $database, $line );

Store the resource record in the database. If C<$database> is
C<undef> or not an existing database, a new one will be created and
the handle stored in C<$database>.

=head2 EXTENSION XCOMPOSITE

This is an optional extension.  If you have Xcomposite available when this
module was installed, then the following functions will be available.
None of these functions are exportable.

  sudo apt-get install libxcomposite-dev   # Debian/Mint/Ubuntu
  sudo yum install libXcomposite-devel     # Fedora/RHEL

=head3 XCompositeVersion

  my $version_integer= X11::Xlib::XCompositeVersion()
    if X11::Xlib->can('XCompositeVersion');

=head3 XCompositeQueryExtension

  my ($event_base, $error_base)= $display->XCompositeQueryExtension
    if $display->can('XCompositeQueryExtension');

=head3 XCompositeQueryVersion

  my ($major, $minor)= $display->XCompositeQueryVersion
    if $display->can('XCompositeQueryVersion');

=head3 XCompositeRedirectWindow

=head2 EXTENSION XRENDER

This is an optional extension.  If you have Xrender available when this
module was installed, then the following functions will be available.
None of these functions are exportable.

  sudo apt-get install libxrender-dev   # Debian/Mint/Ubuntu
  sudo yum install libXrender-devel     # Fedora/RHEL

=head3 XRenderQueryExtension

  my ($event_base, $error_base)= $display->XRenderQueryExtension()
    if $display->can('XRenderQueryExtension');

=head3 XRenderQueryVersion

  my ($major, $minor)= $display->XRenderQueryVersion()
    if $display->can('XRenderQueryVersion');

=head3 XRenderFindVisualFormat

  my $pfmt= $display->XRenderFindVisualFormat( $visual );

Takes a L<X11::Xlib::Visual>, and returns a L<X11::Xlib::XRenderPictFormat>.

=head1 STRUCTURES

Xlib has a lot of C B<struct>s.  Most of them do not have much "depth"
(i.e. pointers to further nested structs) and so I chose to represent them
as simple blessed scalar refs to a byte string.  This gives you the ability
to pack new values into the struct which might not be known by this module,
and keeps the object relatively lightweight.  Most also have a C<pack> and
C<unpack> method which convert from/to a hashref.
Sometimes however these structs do contain a raw pointer value, and so you
should take extreme care if you do modify the bytes.

Xlib also has a lot of B<opaque pointers> where they just give you a pointer
and some methods to access it without any explanation of its inner fields.
I represent these with the matching Perl feature for blessed opaque references,
so the only way to interact with the pointer value is through XS code.
In each case, when the object goes out of scope, this library calls any
appropriate "Free" function.

Finally, there are lots of objects which exist on the server, and Xlib just
gives you a number (L</XID>) to refer to them when making future requests.
Windows are the most common example.  Since these are simple integers, and
can be shared among any program connected to the same display, this module
allows a mix of simple scalar values or blessed objects when calling any
function that expects an C<XID>.  The blessed objects derive from L<X11::Xlib::XID>.

Most supported structures have their own package with further documentation,
but here is a quick list:

=head2 Display

Represents a connection to an X11 server.  Xlib provides an B<opaque pointer>
C<Display*> on which you can call methods.  These are represented by this
package, C<X11::Xlib>.  The L<X11::Xlib::Display> package provides a more
perl-ish interface and some helper methods to "DWIM".

=head2 Screen

The Xlib C<Screen*> is not exported by this module, since most methods that
use a C<Screen*> have a matching method that uses a C<Display*>.
If you are using the object-oriented L<Display|X11::Xlib::Display> you then
get L<Screen|X11::Xlib::Screen> objects for convenience, but they are just
a wrapper around the Display and screen number instead of screen pointer.

=head2 Visual

An B<opaque pointer> describing binary representation of pixels for some mode of
the display.  There's probably only one in use on the entire display (i.e. RGBA)
but Xlib makes you look it up and pass it around to various functions.

=head2 XVisualInfo

A more useful B<struct> describing a Visual.  See L<X11::Xlib::XVisualInfo>.

=head2 XEvent

A B<struct> that can hold any sort of message sent to/from the server.  The struct
is a union of many other structs, which you can read about in L<X11::Xlib::XEvent>.

=head2 Colormap

An B<XID> referencing what used to be a palette for 8-bit graphics but which is
now mostly a useless appendage to be passed to L</XCreateWindow>.  When using
the object-oriented C<Display>, these are wrapped by L<X11::Xlib::Colormap>.

=head2 Pixmap

An B<XID> referencing a rectangular pixel buffer.  Has dimensions and color
depth and is bound to a L</Screen>.  Can be used for copying images, or tiling.
When using the object-oriented C<Display>, these are wrapped by L<X11::Xlib::Pixmap>.

=head2 Window

An B<XID> referencing a Window.  Used for painting, event/input delivery, and
having data tagged to them.  Not abused nearly as much as the Win32 API abuses
its Window structures.  See L<X11::Xlib::Window> for details.

=head1 ERROR HANDLING

Error handling in Xlib is pretty bad.  The first problem is that non-fatal
errors are reported asynchronously in an API masquerading as if they were
synchronous function calls.
This is mildly annoying.  This library eases the pain by giving you a nice
L<XEvent|X11::Xlib::XEvent> object to work with, and the ability to deliver
the errors to a callback on your display or window object.

The second much larger problem is that fatal errors (like losing the connection
to the server) cause a mandatory termination of the host program.  Seriously.
The default behavior of Xlib is to print a message and abort, but even if you
install the C error handler to try to gracefully recover, when the error
handler returns Xlib still kills your program.  Under normal circumstances you
would have to perform all cleanup with your stack tied up through Xlib, but
this library cheats by using croak (C<longjmp>) to escape the callback and let
you wrap up your script in a normal manner.  B<However>, after a fatal
error Xlib's internal state could be damaged, so it is unsafe to make any more
Xlib calls.  This library tries to help enforce that by invalidating all the
connection objects.

If you really need your program to keep running your best bet is to state-dump
to shared memory and then C<exec()> a fresh copy of your script and reload the
dumped state.  Or use XCB instead of Xlib.
